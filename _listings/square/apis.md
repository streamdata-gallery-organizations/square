    - Values for the `customer_card_id` and `customer_id` parameters (to charge
    a customer's card on file)

    [Square chargeback protection](https://squareup.com/help/article/5394), you
    _must_ provide values for the following parameters in your request:

    - `buyer_email_address`
    - At least one of `billing_address` or `shipping_address`

    When this response is returned, the amount of Square's processing fee might not yet be
    calculated. To obtain the processing fee, wait about ten seconds and call
    [RetrieveTransaction](#endpoint-retrievetransaction). See the `processing_fee_money`
